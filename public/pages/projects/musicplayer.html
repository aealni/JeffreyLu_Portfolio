            <p class="mb-4"> This project inspiration simply came from watching a band anime and wanting to sort of create a themed music player for that band's music. So far, this project utilizes Electron Js to use web technologies like Chromium and Node.js to create cross-platform desktop applications (as I don't wish to host this on the web just yet). </p>
            <p class="mb-4"> I have created the general framework of the music player. This includes standard actions like loop, fast forward, play, pause. Planned updates in the future mainly revolve around UI as I plan on making it look more presentable and aesthetic. I want the player to feel more polished and visually themed around the anime, which means exploring how to incorporate custom graphics, animations, and possibly even visualizers.</p>
            <p class="mb-4"> This project was cool in that it is my first forage into creating complete applications from scratch. I learned a lot about QOL features and how to best test functionality to make them robust to unexpected actions (for example, what should happen if you press fast forward but there is less than 10 seconds remaining). I expect to also learn a lot about incorporating graphics and application design in the future as I create some artwork to make the application look more pleasing. Overall, this has been a fun and personal side project that’s tied closely to my interests, and it’s shown me how development can be a way to build things that genuinely reflect your own hobbies and creativity. </p>
