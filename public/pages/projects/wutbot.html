            <p class="mb-4"> WutBot is a general-purpose Discord bot I built to automate and enhance server interactions for a small friend group. While it started as a lightweight utility bot, it evolved into something a bit more specialized — incorporating tools for querying data from the game <em>Azur Lane</em>, along with a few entertainment-focused features from music playback and simple stat tracking to blackjack. </p> 
            <p class="mb-4"> The bot was built using Python, with Discord’s official API wrapper for bot command handling. Commands range from basic utility responses like ping to more interactive features. Although version control wasn’t set up at the time — this being more of a late-night project than a production tool — it taught me a lot about structuring feature-specific logic in a modular way. </p> 
            <p class="mb-4"> One of the more technical components was the implementation of a query system for <em>Azur Lane</em>. To make bot queries feel responsive and accurate, I used <code>BeautifulSoup</code> to scrape structured content directly from the game's official wiki. Combined with the <code>jaro</code> similarity metric, the bot could return matches even when user input had typos or partial matches, making search queries feel intuitive and forgiving. </p> 
            <p class="mb-4"> For voice channels, WutBot supported music playback using <code>youtube_dl</code>. Users could queue tracks, skip songs, and stream audio from YouTube directly into a shared voice channel — a feature that, while somewhat common among Discord bots, added to the utility and social engagement of the bot during active sessions. </p> <p class="mb-4"> The bot also included lightweight persistence through a simple key-value store. This was used to power minigames, store custom server-specific data, and track fun stats like command usage counts or streaks for certain games. While rudimentary, this local data handling kept things fast and simple and taught me the foundations of data storage as I begin venturing into full relational databases. </p> 
            <p class="mb-4"> Overall, WutBot was a great way to get hands-on experience integrating external libraries, handling asynchronous Python tasks, and experimenting with user-friendly interaction design on Discord. With a focus on simple yet effective commands being the basis of Discord bots, I learned how to incorporate user feedback to improve software. </p>
