            This was my very first real-world programming project, developed for my high school’s 2023 hackathon.  Working with a small team of classmates, we created a browser-based tool that could analyze videos and detect custom image labels using machine learning.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
            We used TensorFlow for model training and Svelte for the frontend. One of my main contributions was designing the HTML structure and integrating the trained model into our web interface. I also helped build the image labeling workflow and figure out how we could upload and organize training data in Google (using what I believe is a now-deprecated tool as I cannot seem to find it online), allowing us to fine-tune a model on custom inputs and use those weights in real-time. 
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
            Beyond the technical implementation, this was a deep lesson in teamwork. We divided tasks based on what each person was best at, following the idea of comparative advantage. I focused on HTML and the ML integration/theory, while others handled more of the JavaScript or styling.We used Git for version control, which helped us combine our work smoothly and keep everything organized. It was also a good lesson in how to split up tasks to avoid merge conflicts and how important it is to test things properly before pushing code so we don’t accidentally break something. Throughout the event, we were constantly learning from each other, debugging in groups, and pushing new changes live under a tight deadline (the 24 hour window).
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
            This project wasn’t just about the final product - it was about learning how to collaborate, break down a problem, and build something meaningful from scratch. It sparked my long-term interest in machine learning and software development, and showed me how exciting it is to turn abstract ideas into real, working software - it was so much fun actually using the software that we built. Not only that, it was also inspiring to see how machine learning and neural networks could be applied to solve such complex problems with real consequences (tooth health).
