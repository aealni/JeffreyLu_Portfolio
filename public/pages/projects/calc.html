                This project is a simple GUI calculator built using C++ and Windows Forms. It combines basic C++ logic with graphical interface design, making it more interactive compared to standard console-based programs. I sort of see this project as an extension of classic Scratch programs, except most stuff being physically programmed rather than dragged and dropped with blocks
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with positive and negative numbers. I designed the interface using C++/CLI using Visual Studio, which allows for creating Windows-style buttons, text fields, and layout elements.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                One of the interesting parts of this project was connecting the visual elements to the backend logic. When you click a button (for example, a number or an operator), an event is triggered, updating the display or performing the calculation. It’s a good example of event-driven programming, which is common in building desktop applications.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Even though it’s a basic calculator, building it from scratch in C++ with forms gave me a better understanding of both GUI frameworks and how to manage application state within a user-friendly interface.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project helped bridge the gap between low-level programming and real-world applications with graphical interfaces, and gave me experience with the Windows Forms environment in C++ as well as what goes into developing a complete desktop application.
